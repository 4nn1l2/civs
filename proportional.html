<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
CIVS supports an experimental mode in which it can be
used to select multiple candidates while enforcing
proportional representation. Roughly speaking, a set of voters can
only influence the selection of a fraction of the selected
candidates that is proportional to the number of voters.
</p>

<p>
For example, suppose that 60% of the voters want candidates
<i>A</i>, <i>B</i>, <i>C</i>, <i>D</i>, and <i>E</i>, in that order, and 40% want <i>X</i>, <i>Y</i>, <i>Z</i>, <i>U</i>, and <i>V</i>.
Ordinary Condorcet voting will rank
<i>A</i>, <i>B</i>, <i>C</i>, <i>D</i>, and <i>E</i> higher
than the other five candidates, because a majority likes
them better. For some tasks, this is the right way to run
the election. However, if the election is selecting a
five-person committee to
represent the whole population, 40% would have no representation
at all. The proportional representation algorithm used by
CIVS would elect the candidates <i>A</i>, <i>B</i>, <i>C</i>, <i>X</i>, and
<i>Y</i> (we will write this result as <i>ABCXY</i>), achieving
perfect proportional representation.
</p>

<h2>Determining the winning committee</h2>

The rule used is a generalization of ordinary Condorcet
voting. First, preferences expressed on
individual candidates are lifted to obtain preferences on whole committees of
<i>k</i> members. Then
Condorcet methods are used to pick the &ldquo;best&rdquo;
committee. The trick is to lift the preferences in a way
that doesn't simply let a majority dictate the composition
of the committee.

We say that a given voter has an <i>f</i>-preference for
possible committee <i>A</i> over another, <i>B</i>,
if the voter prefers <i>A</i> to <i>B</i> when considering only
the <i>f</i> most preferred candidates on each committee.
We can compare any two possible committees for all values of
<i>f</i> from 1 to <i>k</i> by determining for each voter
and each value of <i>f</i> whether they have an <i>f</i>-preference for one of the two
committees over the other, and summing up the number of
voters with a preference for one and the number with a
preference for the other. Suppose that the number of voters
with a preference for committee 1 is <i>v</i> and there are
<i>n</i> voters overall. Then an <i>f</i>-preference for
committee 1 is <b>valid</b> if
<i>v</i>(<i>k</i>+1)/<i>n</i> &#8805; <i>f</i>.
Invalid preferences are usually ignored in deciding the winner; to decide whether
committee 1 is preferred over committee 2, we find the
largest <i>f</i> such that <i>v</i> voters have a valid
<i>f</i>-preference for one of the two committees. This <i>v</i>
becomes the strength of the preference in the ordinary
Condorcet sense; this is called the <i>proportional preference</i> here.
If there is no proportional preference
for one committee over the other, then the full <i>k</i>-preference
(the <i>nonproportional preference</i>) is used to break the tie. This rule allows majorities to break ties
in cases where the minority is indifferent.</p>
<p>For <i>k</i>=1, this voting
scheme is simply the ordinary Condorcet scheme. For
larger <i>k</i>, it yields proportional results. In the
above example, the 60% have no valid preference for
<i>ABCDE</i> over <i>ABCXY</i> because their maximum
valid preference is a 3-preference (because 3/6 &le; 60% &lt; 4/6).
The 40%, on the other hand, have a valid 2-preference for the second result
(because 2/6 &le; 40% &lt; 3/6), so <i>ABCXY</i> is the winning committee,
as desired.</p>

<p>The factor (<i>k</i>+1) may be surprising in the validity condition,
but it actually agrees with proportional representation voting schemes
developed elsewhere; it is analogous to the
<a href="http://www.encyclopedia4u.com/d/droop-quota.html">
Droop quota</a> used by many STV election methods.
Suppose the factor were changed to
<i>k</i>. In that case, a set of voters would be
unable to influence the selection of a candidate unless they were large
enough to form a bloc of size <i>n</i>/<i>k</i>. For example, suppose that <i>k</i>=2 and
a bare majority favors candidates <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>,
while a slightly smaller minority
favors <i>C</i> and <i>D</i>.
In this case the minority would have no valid preference
for <i>C</i> and the winners would be <i>AB</i>. However, the
right result is clearly <i>AC</i>. As long as the minority has
least 1/3 of the voters, it will be represented by <i>C</i>. If the
minority has less than 1/3, then we can view the majority as consisting
of two blocs deserving representation, and both larger than the minority.
So in that case the right result is <i>AB</i>, which is achieved because
a 2/3 majority has a valid 2-preference in this case.
</p>
<p>
When the fraction
of voters in each bloc don't match perfectly with the attainable fractions
of seats, there is always some unfairness because some voters will be
overrepresented and some underrepresented. Using a <i>k</i>+1 factor
balances this unfairness so that a voter is overrepresented by at most
a (<i>k</i>+1)/<i>k</i> factor. In the example just given, at the 1/3
point the majority (2/3) bloc has 50% (3/2) overrepresentation if it wins and
the minority (1/3) bloc also has 50% overrepresentation if it wins.
Using a different criterion for when a proportional preference is valid
would result in a higher level of overrepresentation in some cases.
</p>

<h2>Determining a voter's preference</h2>

<p>There is also the question of how to decide whether a voter prefers
one committee over another. In proportional representation mode, there
is only one difference from the voter's perspective: instead of ranking
the candidates, the voter gives
a nonnegative <b>weight</b> to each candidate. The voting algorithm
decides which of two committees would be preferred by a candidate using
one of two criteria, <i>combined weights</i> or <i>best candidate</i>:

<p>
<a name="combinedrating">
<strong>Combined weights.</strong>
</a>
The voter's goal is to maximize the sum of weights
of selected candidates. This is an appropriate criterion for elections where
the quality of all the candidates is important to the voters, such as
the election of an actual committee that will be voting on some issues.
Weights make it possible to compare
sets of candidates with different cardinality. For example,
suppose that a voter wants candidates <i>A</i>, <i>B</i>,
and <i>C</i>, in that
order, but would end up (because of the other voters'
preferences) choosing between <i>A</i> and the pair
<i>BC</i>. The
algorithm can't tell just from the rankings whether the
voter would prefer to have the better candidate
<i>A</i> or 
greater representation under <i>BC</i>. Using weights this
can be determined: if <i>A</i> is given a weight of
10 and <i>B</i> and <i>C</i> have weights 8 and 6 respectively, then the voting
algorithm will (on the voter's behalf) work towards electing
<i>BC</i> in preference to <i>A</i>, because 14 &gt; 10.
However, if <i>B</i> and <i>C</i> were instead given weights 4 and 2, the voter would have expressed that <i>A</i> is preferred to <i>BC</i> because 6 &lt; 10.<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="bestcandidate">
<strong>Best candidate.</strong>
</a>
With this criterion, the voter's goal is to get a single very good candidate
elected possible, and the quality of other elected candidates is a strictly
secondary consideration.  This is appropriate for an election where the voter
really only cares about the best candidate: for example, the selection of a
set of entree dishes for a menu, where the voter will only eat one of
the entrees.  Here, two committees are compared using their best candidates
(according to the voter); other candidates are considered only if the voter has
no preference between the best candidates. In the examples above, <i>A</i>
would be preferred to <i>BC</i> in either case, because <i>A</i> is preferred
to <i>B</i>.</p>

<h2>Algorithm</h2>

<p>
The voting scheme described above can be evaluated in
a brute-force form by computing a preference
matrix for all <i>f</i> in 1..<i>k</i>, where the matrix has size
<b>C</b>(<i>c</i>,<i>k</i>)&times;<b>C</b>(<i>c</i>,<i>k</i>),
where <i>c</i> is the number of candidates, and <b>C</b> is
the combinatoric choose function. The storage and computational overhead of
this brute-force computation is prohibitive for even moderately
large <i>n</i> and <i>k</i>. Therefore, this is not how the actual
CIVS implementation works.
</p>

<p>
The current technique for identifying the winning committee is less
expensive but may be incomplete. The current implementation performs a local
search through the space of committees to identify the Schwartz set of
committees: all committees that are beaten only by other committees in
the set. (However, the correctness of the algorithm depends on a
currently unproved conjecture: that if improvement of a committee is
possible, it can be done by replacing one member at a time.) The
beatpath winner algorithm is run using all committees explored during
the search for the Schwartz set. An interactive form also allows
comparison of any two sets.  However, the output of the system in this
mode must be currently be interpreted with some caution: while no
counterexamples have been found, there is no proof that the current
implementation always finds the winning committee according to the
above criteria.
