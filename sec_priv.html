<p>The Condorcet Internet Voting Service is designed to protect the security and
privacy of participants:
<ul>
<li>No e-mail addresses are released to any third party. The e-mail address
of the election supervisor is made known to the designated voters.
<li>The identity of a voter is known only to the election supervisor
and the individual voter. The election supervisor knows how many voters
cast votes, but has no other information about whether or how a given voter
voted.
<li>E-mail addresses of voters are destroyed immediately after the election
begins.
<li>The election supervisor can determine whether a voter has voted
only with the permission of the voter and only after the election has ended.
<li>Once a private election is complete, only the following information
is retained: the name of the election, the choices offered, the identity of the supervisor
and the matrix of votes cast. The identity of all voters is destroyed.
<li>The election supervisor receives a digitally signed statement
containing the list of all voters and an indication of whether they
have voted. (Not yet implemented)
<!-- <li>
Voters receive a receipt that
enables them to check that their vote was cast correctly. (Not yet implemented)
The issue is that there is also value in preventing voters from proving how they
voted on the issue. Technical issues remain to be resolved about how
to reconcile these integrity and repudiation properties. -->
</ul>
