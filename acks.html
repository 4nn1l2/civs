Andrew Myers built the initial version of the system.
</p>

<p>
Michael Clarkson designed and implemented the protocols that
protect voter identity. He also added the ballot reporting feature
and cleaned up the code quite a bit.
</p>

<p>Nate Nystrom and TP Wong helped design the user interface.</p>

<p>David Gamble gave helpful critiques of
the proportional representation method.
Steve Eppley gave useful pointers on MAM and
related methods.
Chris Benham helped with the "runoff" method.</p>

<p>Localization for languages other than English was provided by
volunteers: &Aacute;rp&aacute;d Magos&aacute;nyi (Hungarian), 
Jacopo Corbetta (Italian), Pascal Levasseur
and Michel Billard Sarakawa (French),
Julian Mehnle (German), Tom Dromi and Roey Perlstein-Dvir (Hebrew).
</p>

<p>Contributions and feedback are always welcome!</p>
<ul>
<li>
Additional language support would be
great if there are more volunteers out there. Some languages are
frequently used in CIVS polls but are not yet supported; these languages
include Spanish, Portuguese, Hebrew, Russian, and Norwegian.
</li>
<li>It would be great to have a nice logo for CIVS. If you like designing logos
and would like to contribute one, email your suggestion to Andrew Myers. We plan
to run a poll to pick the best logo sometime in Fall 2010.
