Andrew Myers built the initial version of the system.

Michael Clarkson designed and implemented the protocols that
protect voter identity. He also added the ballot reporting feature
and cleaned up the code quite a bit.
</p>

<p>Nate Nystrom and TP Wong helped design the user interface.</p>

<p>David Gamble gave helpful critiques of
the proportional representation method.
Steve Eppley gave useful pointers on MAM and
related methods.
Chris Benham helped with the "runoff" method.</p>

<p>Support for languages other than English was provided by several
volunteers: &Aacute;rp&aacute;d Magos&aacute;nyi (Hungarian), 
Jacopo Corbetta (Italian), Pascal Levasseu (French).</p>

<p>Contributions by others are always welcome! Support for
additional languages is especially solicited at this point.</p>
