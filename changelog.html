Most users use the existing CIVS web server. However, the software is
available for installation elsewhere, subject to certain restrictions
described in the included README file.

	<b>Note:</b> Another voting system, known as
	<a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/projects/civitas">
	Civitas</a>,
	is also under development at Cornell.
	This new system, described in a 
	<a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/clarkson/papers/clarkson_civs_tr.pdf">technical report</a>,
	uses much more complex cryptographic protocols to provide universal verifability 
	and coercion resistance.  The new system is available for download,
	but it does not yet have a user interface.
	The link below provides the
	source code for the Condorcet Internet Voting Service.

Recent updates:
<ul>
<li>2.12:
<ul>
<li>Support for test polls in which ballots are uploaded.
<li>Record start time of polls.
<li>Better write-in filtering.
</ul>

<li>2.11:
<ul>
<li>Elections are now called "polls" uniformly, per a user suggestion.
<li>Results are now cached, which should improve server performance
a great deal for large polls.
<li>Schulze algorithm now uses "against" preferences in addition to "for"
preferences. It now tends to agree with CIVS RP more often, perhaps because
it no longer throws away information that CIVS RP uses.
<li>All completion methods are now in a standardized form, which makes
it easy to add new completion methods. It requires writing a Perl package
that implements <code>rank_candidates</code> and <code>print_details</code>,
and modifying two tables at the top of the "results" script.

<li>Some formatting cleanup of code.
</ul>
<li>2.10:
<ul>
<li>Elections with write-ins now have voting initially disabled. It can
be enabled explicitly from the control page. This allows write-ins to
be on the same footing as other choices.
<li>The election results page has a progress bar, which gives reassuring
feedback for the more expensive completion methods.
</ul>
</li>
<li>2.9:
<ul>
<li>Added filtering of HTML tags to remove possible XSS attacks, etc. Most
useful HTML markup still permitted.
<li>Various cleanup of code and documentation.
<li>Fixed a small but crippling bug in restricted release of results.
</ul>
<li>2.8:
<ul>
<li>Better checking of email addresses to prevent sending bogus emails.
<li>Voter emails now come from CIVS supervisor instead of election supervisor.
<li>Cleaned-up completion algorithm code allows adding new completion
    algorithms more easily.
<li>Corrected description of runoff.
</ul>
<li>2.7:
<ul>
<li>Ability to release election results only to a limited set of users.
<li>Better client-side sanity checking at election creation.
<li>Previewing of election description and choice list.
<li>Another completion algorithm (runoff)
<li>Better factoring out of completion algorithms to allow future
    algorithms to be added more easily.
<li>Allow voters' identity to be revealed as an election option
<li>Mail to voters is now HTML+ASCII (should be made optional) to help
    get through spam filters.
</ul>
</ul>

the source tree often contains code that has not yet been pushed to the server
and that may not be ready for general release.
