the source tree</a>. Note that
the source tree often contains code that has not yet been pushed to the server.

<ul>
<li>June 28, 2004: Michael Clarkson implemented the new voting and authorization protocol.</li>
<li>June 14, 2004: A couple of race conditions were fixed that apparently led
to the failure of one high-load (about 2000 voters) election. Also, fixed a bug in reporting results in
proportional mode (a set could appear more than once).
</li>
<li>June 6, 2004: Added tooltips to the result matrices, which makes it easier to
see what each number represents. Michael Clarkson also cleaned up the code a fair
amount (modernized Perl idioms).
</li>
<li>May 31, 2004: Added MAM comparison mode under detailed results.</li>
<li>May 27, 2004: Michael Clarkson added detailed ballot reporting.</li>
</ul>
