<h2>Setting up an election</h2>
<ol>
<li><b>What is the difference between Condorcet voting and voting methods
that I am familiar with?</b><br>
Condorcet voting methods let voters rank their preferences and do a good
job of aggregating all the voter preferences into a single ranking.
[&nbsp;<a href="rp.html">More&nbsp;information on Condorcet voting</a>&nbsp;]

<li><b>For how long a period should I enable voting?</b><br>
This is up to you. The best time period depends on your voters.
For voters who are aware of the election or who check email frequently,
a couple of days is usually enough time. Most people vote right away, or
not at all. Election durations of more than a week are usually too
long, unless your intention is to set up a long-running public survey.
</li>

<li><b>I would like to separate out the acceptable choices from the
unacceptable choices. Can I do that?</b><br>
Just create a choice named something like &ldquo;choices ranked below this
are unacceptable&rdquo;. You can then use the election results in
various ways. If you want reject choices that are considered unacceptable
by a plurality of voters, reject those that are ranked below this pseudo-choice.
If you want to find the choices that are acceptable to <i>every</i> voter,
they are the ones that unananimously (n&ndash;0) beat this pseudo-choice.
(This is handy for scheduling meetings where everyone needs to be present.)
</li>

<li><b>How big an election can I run?</b><br>
CIVS is used regularly for elections with hundreds of voters.  You can set up a
public election where any number of people can vote.  Elections have been
successfully run with a couple of thousand voters, and this is a load it should
stand up to even if voters all try to vote around the same time. CIVS hasn't
been tested at 10,000 voters or higher, and since the server is implemented in
Perl, it isn't as fast as it could be&mdash;there is reason to think it may
fall over at that level of load. A Java version is in the works.  If you want
to have a private election, the system will only allow you to add 1,000 voters
at a time, but in principle you can have as many voters as you want. Note that
making your election proportional dramatically increases the load on the CIVS
server, so you may want to avoid that mode for large elections.
<li>
<b>How reliable is CIVS?</b><br>
We haven't had any data losses due to hardware failure. A couple of years ago
the CIVS server machine had a disk failure, but we were able to recover
election data from backups and move the service to a new machine.  A bug (a
subtle race condition) in CIVS code caused some corruption of voting data in
one large election a couple of years ago, but it does not seem to have affected
the election result. The race condition has long since been fixed. Since
elections are stored in separate databases, it only affected the one election.

<li>
<b>A complete ranking of choices could embarrass some candidates. Can I avoid
that?</b><br>
Ordinarily, full election results are available to every voter. However,
you can designate a smaller set of people who are allowed to see the election
results. They can then report the winners to the voters.
</ol>

<h2>Running an election</h2>
<ol>
<li><b>Some voters never got their voter keys. What do I do?</b><br>
It depends on whether you sent the voter key to the right address in the first
place. If so, you can send it again by "adding" that voter with the
election control page. The same voter key will be generated, so
the voter won't be able to vote twice. If the email address was broken,
then email should have bounced. In that case it should be safe to add
the voter under their correct email address. You can check with the CIVS
supervisor whether the email bounced, assuming you were not notified.
</li>

<li><b>Why doesn't the election end automatically at the specified time?</b><br>
We wanted to give election supervisors the flexibility to write complex
specifications of when the election should end, such as &ldquo;by March 3 or
when we get at least 100 votes&rdquo;. It's too hard to handle all these cases.
The supervisor can keep tabs on the election progress through the election
control page.
</li>

<li><b>The voters haven't bothered to vote. Can I send them their voter
keys again?</b><br> Yes, just "add" them again at the election control page.
This will send them all email. Make sure you use exactly the same email address
you did the first time; otherwise, a new voter key will be generated because
it's a different voter as far as CIVS can tell.
</li>
<li>
<b>How long will the election results remain available?</b><br>
We are making a best effort to keep election results forever, for any election
that receives more than one vote and doesn't look like a test of the system.
However, you may want to make a copy of the election results page for
posterity.
</li>
<li><b>Why doesn't the system notify the voters when the election has ended?</b><br>
Because it doesn't know who the voters are any more. Once voter keys are
sent out, all information about the voters is destroyed. It's the job of
the election supervisor to close the election and notify voters or
result recipients.
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Voting</h2>
<ol>
<li><b>What does &ldquo;no opinion&rdquo; mean?</b><br>
It means you are providing no information about how this choice ranks with
respect to the other choices. Voters often pick &ldquo;no opinion&rdquo; when
what they mean is that they don't like the choice or they don't have any
information about it. These are probably reasons to rank the choice low.
</ol>
