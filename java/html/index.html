<p>This free,    
automated web service makes it easy to collect and anonymously     
summarize the opinions of a number of people
regarding some topic of interest.
A voter is given a set of possible choices and is allowed to rank
them. These rankings are combined and used to report a ranking
generated from the opinions of all the voters.
You might use this Internet voting service to:</p>

<p>
<table align="center" class="form">
<tr><td>
<ul>
<li>Elect the president of an organization</li>
<li>Elect a committee</li>
<li>Choose a project name</li>
<li>Pick book club selections</li>
</ul>
</td>
<td>
<ul>
<li>Pick a restaurant to eat at</li>
<li>Identify the ten most favorite movies</li>
<li>Create a party menu</li>
<li>Select a meeting time</li>
</ul>
</td></tr>

<p>
Here's how it works.
Anyone is allowed to create a new CIVS election, and only
authorized voters will know about it. Voters and the election supervisor
must have e-mail and web access. When an election is created,      
voters are sent e-mail informing them that the election is open and     
giving them a URL where they can rank their choices.
Open, public polls may also be created for which voters do not need e-mail access;
however, the results of such polls are less trustworthy.
</p>

<p>
Because this voting system allows voters to rank their choices, rather  
than just picking their most preferred choice, it avoids problems        
like vote splitting and spoilers, and reduces the general problem       
of strategic voting. Australia is an example of a country that uses     
a voting system with ranked preferences, Instant Runoff Voting. The     
Condorcet voting system used by this service is better at identifying
consensus candidates. Another name for Condorcet methods
is Instant Round-Robin Voting, because every candidate is compared against
every other candidate, unlike Instant Runoff Voting where a consensus
candidate can be eliminated in early rounds. CIVS also supports
proportional representation.
