<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>CIVS currently supports two algorithms for Condorcet completion.
These algorithms are relevant when there is a cycle in the preferences
given by the voters. If there is no cycle, all Condorcet algorithms
will arrive at the same ranking. Cycles do happen, but in practice,
cycles involving the top-ranked choice seem to be relatively rare.
There, if the goal of the election is simply to pick the top choice,
it usually doesn't matter which algorithm is used.</p>

<p>The completion algorithms
supported by CIVS are the Beatpath Winner algorithm,
also known as <a href="http://electionmethods.org/CondorcetEx.htm">
Cloneproof Schwartz Sequential Dropping</a>, and
a variation of the Ranked Pairs algorithm called <b>CIVS Ranked Pairs</b>
here. This page describes the CIVS ranked pairs algorithm.</p>

<h2>Algorithm</h2>

<p>The CIVS ranked pairs algorithm here is a deterministic
variant of Eppley's
<a href="http://alumnus.caltech.edu/~seppley/">Maximize
Affirmed Majorities</a>,
and is also related to other algorithms such as
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranked_Pairs">
Tideman/Ranked Pairs</a>.
In these algorithms, each of the pairwise preferences in the preference matrix
is considered in in the order of the strength of the preference, and either
<b>kept</b> (<b>affirmed</b>) if it does not create cycles, or else ignored.

<h3>Affirming preferences</h3>

<p>
In the CIVS ranked
pairs algorithm, as in MAM, one preference is stronger than another if it has
more votes in favor, or if the number of votes in favor are equal, if the
preference has fewer votes against.  Of course, it is entirely possible that
two preferences have exactly the same number of votes in favor and against.
Like MAM and unlike Tideman, the ordering of preferences does not take margins
into account.

The major difference between CIVS Ranked Pairs and MAM is that a preference is
kept exactly when it does not create any <i>new</i> cycles when considered in
conjunction with <i>strictly stronger</i>, kept preferences. Thus, preferences
of equal strength may be kept even though in conjunction they produce a new
cycle, as long as individually they do not.
</p>

<h3>Ranking the choices</h3>

<p>After considering all preferences, any choices involved in a cycle of kept
preferences are considered to have tied with each other.  There is no
tie-breaking mechanism, as in MAM; the algorithm is deterministic.  The
algorithm for ranking the various choices is to successively identify the
Schwartz sets defined by the graph of kept preferences. The top-ranked choices
are the Schwartz set: the smallest set of choices such that no choices outside
the set are preferred to any in the set. After these choices are removed from
the graph, the second tier of choices are the Schwartz set in the new graph,
and so on. Typically, the Schwartz set consists of a single choice at
every level; ties can only occur if there are preferences of equal strength.
