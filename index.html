<p>Welcome to the Condorcet Internet Voting Service. This is an         
automated system that makes it easy to collect and summarize the        
opinions of a number of people on the internet on some topic of         
interest. Anyone is allowed to create a new CIVS election, and only
authorized voters will know about it. You might use CIVS to:</p>                                                        
<ul>
<li>Elect the president of an organization</li>
<li>Choose a name for a project</li>
<li>Elect a committee</li>
<li>Pick a restaurant</li>
<li>Rank the ten most favorite movies</li>
</ul>

<p>
Voters and the election supervisor
must have e-mail and web access. A voter is given a set of       
possible choices and is allowed to rank them. These rankings are        
combined using a Condorcet-based algorithm and used to report the       
ranking of the entire set of voters.  When you create an election,      
voters are sent e-mail informing them that the election is open and     
giving them a URL where they can rank their choices. You can also
create open elections for which voters do not need e-mail access;
however, the results of such elections are much less trustworthy.
</p>

<p>
Because this voting system allows voters to rank their choices, rather  
than just giving their most preferred choice, it avoids problems        
like vote splitting and spoilers, and reduces the general problem       
of strategic voting. Australia is an example of a country that uses     
a voting system with ranked preferences, Instant Runoff Voting. The     
Condorcet voting system used by this service is better at identifying
consensus candidates. However, IRV in its multiwinner form does a better
job at achieving proportional representation.

<p>
If you are authorized to vote in a private election on this server, you 
should have received an e-mail message with a URL to use when voting.   
There is no other way to access the election. Contact the election supervisor
if you have lost the URL.
