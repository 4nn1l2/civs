<p>Welcome to the Condorcet Internet Voting Service. This is a free,    
automated web service that makes it easy to collect and anonymously     
summarize the opinions of a number of people regarding some    
topic of interest.  You might use CIVS to:<br><br>

<table class="form">
<tr><td>
<ul>
<li>Elect the president of an organization</li>
<li>Choose a name for a project</li>
<li>Elect a committee</li>
</ul>
</td>
<td>
<ul>
<li>Pick a restaurant</li>
<li>Identify the ten most favorite movies</li>
<li>Choose a date or menu for a party</li>
</ul>
</td></tr>
</table>

A voter is given a set of       
possible choices and is allowed to rank them. These rankings are        
combined using a Condorcet-based algorithm and used to report the       
ranking generated using the opinions of the entire set of voters.
</p>
<p>
Anyone is allowed to create a new CIVS election, and only
authorized voters will know about it. Voters and the election supervisor
must have e-mail and web access.
When an election is created,      
voters are sent e-mail informing them that the election is open and     
giving them a URL where they can rank their choices.
Open elections may also be created for which voters do not need e-mail access;
however, the results of such elections are much less trustworthy.
</p>

<p>
Because this voting system allows voters to rank their choices, rather  
than just giving their most preferred choice, it avoids problems        
like vote splitting and spoilers, and reduces the general problem       
of strategic voting. Australia is an example of a country that uses     
a voting system with ranked preferences, Instant Runoff Voting. The     
Condorcet voting system used by this service is better at identifying
consensus candidates, and it also supports proportional
representation.
The Condorcet completion rule used by this
service is Beatpath Winner, also known as Cloneproof Schwartz
Sequential Dropping.
