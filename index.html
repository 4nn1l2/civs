<p>CIVS is a free Internet voting service that makes it easy to conduct
polls on the Web.  Each voter ranks a set of possible choices.
Combined, these rankings are used to construct an overall
ranking that anonymously summarizes the opinions of all voters.
CIVS has been used for many polls and elections. Things
that CIVS has been used to select include:
</p>

<p>
<table class="form">
<tr><td>
<ul>
<li>Officers of organizations</li>
<li>Meeting times</li>
<li>Members of committees</li>
<li>Project names, logos, domain names</li>
<li>Recipients of awards</li>
</ul>
</td>
<td>
<ul>
<li>Restaurants to eat at</li>
<li>Movies to watch</li>
<li>Party menus</li>
<li>Book club selections</li>
<li>Favorite music</li>
</ul>
</td></tr>
</table>
</p>

<p>
<strong>How it works:</strong>
Anyone is allowed to create a new CIVS poll, and only
authorized voters will know about it. Voters and the poll supervisor
must have e-mail and web access. When an poll is created,      
voters are sent e-mail informing them that the poll is open and     
giving them a URL where they can rank their choices.
You may create a poll for which voters do not need e-mail access.
Then one vote is allowed per IP address.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Ranking: </strong>
This voting system allows voters to rank their choices, rather  than just
picking their most preferred choice. Compared to other polling methods, it
collects and uses more information from voters. Ranking choices also avoids
problems with vote splitting and spoilers. Australia is an example of a country
with a voting system based on ranking, Instant Runoff Voting. However, the
Condorcet method used by this service is better at identifying consensus
candidates. Unlike most other Condorcet-based voting systems, CIVS also
supports proportional representation.
</p>
<p>
A new, highly secure version of CIVS called
<a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/projects/civitas">Civitas</a> is under development, and is the subject of a research paper.
Civitas uses much more sophisticated cryptographic protocols to
provide strong anonymity, universal verifiability, and coercion resistance.
